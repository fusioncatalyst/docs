<Warning>
    Fusioncat is currently in its alpha stage. The main API server is located at:

    Please note that breaking changes and bugs are to be expected, as the product is still under active development.
</Warning>

# Authentication Commands

The `paw auth` commands allow you to authenticate with the Fusioncat API.

## Commands

### auth signin

Sign in to an existing Fusioncat account.

```bash
paw auth signin --email <email> --password <password>

# This call will return an authentication token that can be used for subsequent API calls.
# export FC_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-auth-token"
```

#### Options

- `--email` (required): Your email address
- `--password` (required): Your password

#### Examples

```bash
# Sign in without saving token (one-time use)
paw auth signin --email john@example.com --password mypassword

# This call will return an authentication token that can be used for subsequent API calls.
# export FC_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-auth-token"
```

### auth signup

Create a new Fusioncat account.

```bash
paw auth signup --email <email> --password <password>

# This call will return an authentication token that can be used for subsequent API calls.
# export FC_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-auth-token"
```

#### Options

- `--email` (required): Your email address
- `--password` (required): Your password (must be secure)

#### Examples

```bash
# Create new account and save token
paw auth signup --email newuser@example.com --password securepassword
export FC_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-auth-token"
```

### auth me

Get information about the current authenticated user.

```bash
paw auth me
```

This command requires a valid authentication token in the `FC_ACCESS_TOKEN` environment variable.

#### Examples

```bash
# Check current user
paw auth me
```

## Token Management

### Using Environment Variables

```bash
# View your current token
echo $FC_ACCESS_TOKEN

# Manually set a token
export FC_ACCESS_TOKEN="your-auth-token"

# Remove authentication
unset FC_ACCESS_TOKEN
```

### Token Security

- Tokens expire after a certain period (check with your administrator)
- Never commit tokens to version control
- Use environment-specific token management for CI/CD

## Troubleshooting

### Invalid Credentials

If you receive an authentication error:
1. Verify your email and password are correct
2. Check if your account is active
3. Ensure you're using the correct server URL

### Token Expired

If your token has expired:
```bash
# Sign in again to get a new token
paw auth signin --email your@email.com --password yourpassword --save-token
```

### No Token Found

If you see "authentication required" errors:
```bash
# Ensure you have a token set
echo $FC_ACCESS_TOKEN

# If empty, sign in again
paw auth signin --email your@email.com --password yourpassword --save-token
```
