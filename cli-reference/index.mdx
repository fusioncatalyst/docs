# Paw CLI Reference

Paw is the official Fusioncat CLI that helps you manage projects, schemas, applications, and generate code across multiple programming languages.

## Installation

```bash
# Download the latest release
curl -L https://github.com/fusioncatltd/paw/releases/latest/download/paw_$(uname -s)_$(uname -m).tar.gz | tar xz

# Move to your PATH
sudo mv paw /usr/local/bin/

## Getting Started

   paw init-settings-file --server https://api.fusioncat.dev --language typescript
   ```

2. **Authenticate**
   ```bash
   paw auth signin --email your@email.com --password yourpassword
   ```

3. **Create your first project**
