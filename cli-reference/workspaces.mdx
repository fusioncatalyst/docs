# Workspace Management Commands

The `paw workspaces` commands allow you to create and manage workspaces for team collaboration.

## Commands

### workspaces list

List all workspaces you have access to.

```bash
paw workspaces list
```

#### Examples

```bash
# List all workspaces
paw workspaces list
```

### workspaces new

Create a new workspace.

```bash
paw workspaces new --name <name> [--description <description>]
```

#### Options

- `--name` (required): Workspace name
- `--description`: Optional description of the workspace

#### Examples

```bash
# Create a workspace
paw workspaces new --name "Engineering Team" --description "Workspace for the engineering team"

# Create a minimal workspace
paw workspaces new --name "QA Team"
```

## Working with Workspaces

### What are Workspaces?

Workspaces are collaborative environments where teams can:
- Share projects
- Manage access permissions
- Organize resources by team or department
- Collaborate on API definitions

### Workspace Projects

After creating a workspace, you can create projects that belong to it:

```bash
# Create a workspace
paw workspaces new --name "API Team"

# List workspaces to get the ID
paw workspaces list

# Create a project in the workspace
paw projects new --name "Shared APIs" --belongs-to workspace --workspace-id "workspace-uuid"
```

### Workspace Members

Workspace membership and permissions are managed through the FusionCatalyst web interface or API. The CLI focuses on workspace and project creation.

## Best Practices

### Workspace Organization

1. **One workspace per team**: Keep team resources together
2. **Clear naming**: Use descriptive names that identify the team or purpose
3. **Documentation**: Use descriptions to clarify workspace purpose

### Workspace Structure Example

```
FintechEngineeringTeamWorkspace/
├── PaymentProject
├── AccountingProject
└── NotificationsProject

ComplianceEngineeringTeamWorkspace/
├── LegalClaimsProject
└── AntiMoneyLaunderingProject
```

### Access Control

- Workspace owners can manage members
- Members can create and modify projects
- Project-level permissions override workspace permissions

## Examples

### Complete Team Setup

```bash
# 1. Create a workspace for your team
paw workspaces new --name "Backend Team" --description "Backend engineering workspace"

# 2. List workspaces to get the ID
paw workspaces list

# 3. Create a shared project
paw projects new --name "Microservices APIs" --belongs-to workspace --workspace-id "workspace-uuid"

# 4. Team members can now collaborate on the project
paw apps new --project-id "project-uuid" --name "User Service" --description "User management service"
```

### Migration from User to Workspace

If you have personal projects that should be shared:

1. Export the project definition
2. Create a new workspace
3. Create a new project in the workspace
4. Import the project definition

```bash
# Export existing project (through web interface or API)

# Create workspace
paw workspaces new --name "Team Workspace"

# Create new project in workspace
paw projects new --name "Migrated Project" --belongs-to workspace --workspace-id "workspace-uuid"

# Import definition
paw projects import --file ./export.json --project-id "new-project-uuid"
```
