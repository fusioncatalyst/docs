 validating, and migrating an entire Fusioncat project architecture as plain text.'

# Overview

Using `fcproject.yaml`, you can:

* Design your project topology (schemas, messages, servers, resources, apps) in a single file.
* Validate entity names, uniqueness, and cross-references before provisioning.
* Import definitions into Fusioncat to automatically create or update artifacts.
* Export your live project state (with UUIDs) for backup, code generation, or migration.
* Bundle builds (predefined object sets and versions) into portable, attachable manifests.


# File structure

```yaml

# Provision file version
version: <integer>

# Parameters only used during **export** operations
export_parameters:
  include_export_parameters: <boolean>            # Embed this export_parameters block in output
  servers: <boolean>                              # Include server definitions in output
  apps: <boolean>                                 # Include application definitions
  messages: <boolean>                             # Include messages
  schemas: <boolean>                              # Include schemas
  include_only_latest_schema_versions: <boolean>   # If true, include only the latest version of each schema
  include_only_schemas_used_in_messages: <boolean> # If true, include only schemas referenced by messages
  include_descriptions: <boolean>                  # Include description fields for all entities


# Server definitions and their resources
servers:
  - name: <unique>
    type: <string>
    description: <string>
    resources: [...]
    binds: [...]

# Schema definitions (only JSONSchema supported today)
schemas:
  - name: <unique>
    type: jsonschema
    version: <integer>
    description: <string>
    schema: <raw JSON string>      # or example: <JSON instance>

# Message definitions
messages:
  - name: <unique>
    description: <string>
    schema:
      name: <schema-name>
      version: <optional override>

# Application definitions
apps:
  - name: <unique>
    description: <string>
    receives: [...]                # consumer bindings
    sends: [...]                   # producer bindings

```


# Top-Level Fields

* `version` Integer indicating the fcproject file format version. 
Incremented when YAML structure or validation rules change.
* `export_parameters` __(export only)__ Controls which parts of the project are included when exporting.
 Each boolean flag toggles inclusion of that section in the output YAML.
    * `include_export_parameters`: if true, the export_parameters block itself appears in the exported file.
    * `servers / apps / messages / schemas`: include the corresponding top‑level lists.
    * `include_only_latest_schema_versions`: when true, only the highest-numbered version for each schema is exported.
    * `include_only_schemas_used_in_messages`: when true, export only schemas referenced by messages.
    * `include_descriptions`: include description fields for entities throughout the export.
* `servers` A list of server blocks. Each server must have:
    * `name`: unique within the project.
    * `type`: protocol identifier (async+kafka, async+amqp, async+webhook, etc.).
    * `description`: human-readable label.
    * `resources`: array of resources (topics, queues, exchanges, endpoints).
    * `binds` (optional): AMQP-specific bindings linking exchanges to queues.
    * Resource fields:
        * `name`: unique under this server.
        * `mode`: one of read, write, readwrite, or bind.
        * `type`: resource kind (topic, queue, exchange, endpoint, table).
        * `description`: free-form text.
* `schemas` A list of schema definitions. Each schema block includes:
    * `name`: unique identifier.
    * `type`: currently only jsonschema.
    * `version`: sequential integer, starting at 1.
    * `description`: optional summary.
    * `schema`: the JSONSchema document as a string, or
    * `example`: a JSON instance conforming to the schema.
* `messages` A list of message definitions. Each message has:
    * `name`: unique within project.
    * `description`: what the message conveys.
    * `schema`: a nested block referencing
        * `name`: schema name
        * `version`: optional (defaults to the latest version).
* `apps` A list of application definitions. Each application block contains:
    * `name`: unique identifier.
    * `description`: application purpose.
    * `receives` (optional): array of [ message, resource ] pairs the app consumes.
    * `sends` (optional): array of [ message, resource ] pairs the app produces.
        

# Key Rules & Conventions

* Uniqueness: All `name` fields (servers, resources, schemas, messages, apps)
 must be unique within a single project. They can contan latin alphabet leters, digits and _ symbol.
* UUID Assignment:
    * Imported definitions lack UUIDs.
    * Exported or live entities always include a uuid property.
    * Presence of a UUID means the resource already exists in its target server.
* Scoped Definitions:
    * All resources, schemas, messages, and apps defined in fcproject.yaml must belong to the same project.
